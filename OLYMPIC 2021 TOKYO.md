### PROJECT ON OLYMPIC 2021 TOKYO

In this project, we'll work with a dataset containing the names and countries of all those who participated in the Olympic games that was hosted in Tokyo Japan, including all categories of disciplines.

The objective of this project is to establish the most popular discipline among the olympic participants, and the country that had the highest representation in the 2021 Olympic games .



#### Importing the relevant libraries for data wrangling and analysis. 


```python
#Import pandas and matplotlib libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
# Reading the excel file into a pandas DataFrame, 
# and assigning it to a variable called olympic_2021.
olympic_2021 = pd.read_excel('Athletes.xlsx')
olympic_2021
```

### Data Exploration


```python
olympic_2021.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 11085 entries, 0 to 11084
    Data columns (total 3 columns):
     #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype 
    ---  ------      --------------  ----- 
     0   Name        11085 non-null  object
     1   NOC         11085 non-null  object
     2   Discipline  11085 non-null  object
    dtypes: object(3)
    memory usage: 259.9+ KB


From the above exploration, its established that the dataset has no missing values, and its generally a tidy dataset.

It's a dataset that has 11085 rows, and 3 columns.

The Olympic Games that were held in Tokyo,Japan in August 2021 had very interesting details that I'd wish to share with the lovers of the Olympic Games: 

There were a total of 206 NOCs nations that participated in the recently concluded Tokyo Olympic Games with 11,085 paricipating athletes. The United States of America had the highest number of particiants,at 615, reprenting approximately 5.55%, then Japan that sent 586 participants, translating to appoximately 5.28%,followed by Australia at 4.24% of all the articipants. Out of the 206 NOCs nations, 17 of them only had 2 participants each.

There were a total of 47 disciplines. Athletics had the highest number of particiants,at 2068, reprenting approximately 18.66%, then Swimming which had 743 participants, translating to appoximately 6.70%,followed by Football and Rowing at 5.12% and 4.47% respectively, of all the articipants. Trampoline and Cycling BMX Freestyle disciplines had the least numbers, with only 31 and 19 participants respectively.

The pie-chart shared only depicts the percentage share of participants among the first 10 disciplines.
